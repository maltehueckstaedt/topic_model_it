Two key challenges are understanding software structures and their evaluation on the one hand and the improvement of the architecture on the other hand. This master project therefore deals with methods for Architecture Recovery: Creation of an architecture model of a software system from the given implementation and its visualization. Evaluation of the recovered architecture model based on specific metrics. Optimization of the software structure with respect to these metrics. We will use genetic algorithms, neural networks and other machine learning techniques. Examples of software to be analyzed will result from our collaboration with Geomar, as well as using repository mining to automatically analyze open source projects. Lernziele: The students know and can apply advanced software engineering methods and techniques to understand, design, restructure, implement, deploy and evaluate complex software systems. Lehrinhalte: For each edition of this master project, some concrete software development task will be specified to design, implement, deploy and evaluate a complex software system.

It is typically divided into three pillars: Process discovery, conformance checking and process enhancement. This course focuses on the first: Process discovery. Process discovery algorithms take an event log or event stream that consists of recorded events from the business process and mines a process model that represents the control-flow behavior of the business process according to the recorded events. As process models describing the actually executed process behavior are often missing, process discovery algorithms fill that gap such that algorithms belonging to conformance checking and process enhancement can still be applied. To develop and test process discovery algorithms, a known process model either artificially created for that purpose or taken from an application domain can be used to generate event logs or event streams on which the process discovery algorithm is tasked to rediscover the process model underlying the event generation.

The latter scheme is even a (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption scheme, which means that one can use this scheme to carry out computations on encrypted data.\r\n    Applications of Lattice-Based Cryptosystems: Efficient Secure Multi-Party Computation protocols, i.e. protocols to compute arbitrary functions with input from different parties where the parties do not have to reveal their inputs to the other parties. Such protocols can be used, e.g., for privacy-preserving machine learning, i.e., classify data and train models without parties having to reveal their data or models.\r\n\r\nThe most widely used cryptosystems, like RSA encryption and elliptic curve cryptography, are built on the hardness of certain algebraic problems, like the factorization of integers. It is known that a suitable quantum computer could easily solve these underlying mathematical problems in polynomial time and therewith break the corresponding cryptosystems. E.g., the famous quantum algorithm by Shor can break the factorization problem efficiently.This lecture presents state-of-the-art cryptosystems that are post-quantum secure. Post-Quantum secure cryptosystems are not only important to protect against quantum computers. They are also used to construct so-called fully-homomorphic encryption schemes, which allow you to carry out computations on encrypted data. Moreover, they are used in secure Multi-Party Computation protocols, with which you can compute arbitrary functions with input from different parties where the parties do not have to reveal their inputs to the other parties. Such protocols can be used, e.g., to do privacy-preserving machine learning, i.e., classify data and train models without parties having to reveal their data or models. The course gives a self-contained treatment of the topic of post-quantum cryptography such that no prior knowledge of the underlying mathematical or physical theory, apart from elementary algebra, is required.
